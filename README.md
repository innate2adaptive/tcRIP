# TCRIP: T-Cell Receptor Information Prediction

This is the code for the MSc Thesis: "Classification of TCR&beta; Repertoire between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-Cell Populations"

This code has been written by Lewis Iain Moffat in partial completion of the MSc Machine Learning awarded by University College London, Department of Computer Science. This project used a Machine Learning approach to classifying T-Cell Receptor data as either having come from CD4 or CD8 T-Cell lineages. This is done through a combination of feature engineering methods classification algorithms.

## Getting Started
This project does not require installation and only needs to be cloned from the repository. Run the following command to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. Make sure you have git installed.

```git
git clone https://github.com/Groovy-Dragon/tcRIP
```
 

### Prerequisites

These scripts use python 3.5 and a variety of libraries. 

<ul>
    <li> asdf </li>
    <li> asdf </li>
    <li> asdf </li>
    <li> asdf </li>
    <li> asdf </li>
</ul>

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
